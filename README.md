# Updating-a-Gaussian-Belief
This code demonstrates the superiority of Bayes' Statistics in online updating of beliefs. A 'Gaussian Bandit' is initiated, which produces samples from an normal distribution with 'unknown' parameters (they are set in the beginning by the user while initiating the bandit). An updating algorithm refines the estimated parameters and their respective distribution with the incoming data. A 3D plot of the resulting Normal-Inverse-Gamma Distribution is plotted (including contour plots) and a predict function provides the probability of observing values within a specified range.
